Hi, I’m Sowmya R, a backend-oriented problem solver with a strong interest in building structured, reliable systems. 
I work primarily with Java, Data Structures, and Spring Boot, and I focus on understanding why something works,
not just how to make it work.

One of my key strengths is breaking down complex problems into simple, logical steps—whether it’s debugging code,
optimizing an algorithm, or designing a backend flow. I’ve applied this approach while developing a Campus Recruitment 
Management System, where I followed a disciplined, test-driven and modular development process.

What sets me apart is my interest in trust-based collaboration and real-world problem solving.
I actively explore ideas around mentorship platforms, team validation, and systems that help people grow academically 
and professionally—not just technically, but structurally.

I’m consistent, curious, and improvement-driven. I may not rush solutions, but I make sure what 
I build is clean, scalable, and meaningful. I’m looking for an environment where
I can contribute as a reliable engineer while continuously sharpening my skills.
